# ALX Low Level Programming - Variables, if, else, while

This repository contains solutions to the ALX Low Level Programming tasks related to variables, if statements, else statements, and while loops.

## Requirements

- All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All files end with a new line.
- Code follows the Betty style. It is checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- No errors or warnings should occur during compilation.
- The programs should only use the `putchar` function for output.
- The code for each task should be contained in the `main` function.
- Restrictions on specific tasks are mentioned in the task descriptions.
